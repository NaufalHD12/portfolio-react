# **Work Experience**

## **Software Engineer Intern – PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional**

February 2025 – May 2025 | Hybrid

* Developed an AI-powered data entry automation system using Python & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture with an LLM and LangChain to extract information from PDFs, significantly improving data logging efficiency.  
* Designed and built a full-stack web application (PSPV Register) from the ground up using ASP.NET and SQL Server to manage and centralize the equipment deactivation registration process within the refinery.  
* Executed the complete software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis, system architecture design, and feature implementation to testing, ensuring both applications met operational needs.

## **Data Scientist Project-Based Intern – Home Credit Indonesia**

February 2025 – March 2025 | Remote

* Executed an end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection (Mutual Information), and handling class imbalance with SMOTE to optimize model performance.  
* Developed and evaluated credit scoring models using Scikit-Learn and various machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to predict loan repayment likelihood, achieving up to 96% accuracy and F1-score with the final Random Forest model.  
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing credit risk and provided strategic business recommendations to enhance the loan approval process.

# **Projects**

## **Predictive Maintenance Copilot: Use Case by Accenture**

* Architected and led the development of a predictive maintenance platform for the manufacturing sector, orchestrating a microservices (simulator, backend \[Hapi & NodeJS\], ML inference service, agent service) ecosystem to monitor industrial machine health.  
* Implemented real-time event streaming via Socket.IO to deliver critical machine failure alerts and synchronized updates across the dashboard.  
* Engineered an Agentic AI service using FastAPI, LangChain, and LangGraph to analyze telemetry data, providing engineers with real-time health summaries, root cause analysis, and actionable maintenance recommendations.  
* Optimized database performance for time-series workloads by implementing TimescaleDB, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of massive machine sensor logs.

## **EcoTracker: A MERN-stack Application for Tracking Personal Carbon Footprints**

* Architected a robust RESTful API with Node.js and Express, featuring comprehensive OpenAPI documentation for clear frontend integration.  
* Optimized application performance by integrating Redis for efficient caching strategies and Upstash rate limiting to prevent abuse.  
* Secured user data through a JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control (RBAC) and rigorous input validation using Joi.  
* Managed NoSQL data modeling with MongoDB, designing schemas for user profiles, activity logs, and historical tracking data to support scalable growth.

## **Persona Nexus: AI-Powered Community Platform**

* Architected and developed the full-stack web application from scratch using Django, HTMX, and Alpine.js to create a dynamic and interactive community platform.  
* Implemented comprehensive social features, including an OAuth authentication system (Google/Discord social login), dynamic content feeds, real-time voting and notifications, and a private direct messaging system.  
* Integrated AI functionality for an AI Writing Assistant and automated content moderation, which proactively flags inappropriate text for review.
